Jérémie is passionated in designing and building software that are simple and useful. He has 20 years of experiences in various industries and companies of different sizes using a wide range of technology.

Dealing with complexity everyday, both essential and accidental, he is always looking for simplicity. Jérémie is a strong promoter of Domain-Driven-Design and Behavior-Driven Development approaches, that he considers as very efficient ways of designing software. He likes to study complex problems and provide suitable solutions, taking into account all the constraints (scope, cost/delay, quality). I have a strong technical expertise that I combine with a deep work on the domain, in order to provide a lot of value and be able to deal effectively with complexity.
