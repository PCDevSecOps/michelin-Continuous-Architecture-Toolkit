=== Current offerings

==== UNI small business lending

The small business lending products are not at par with competition and are not tailored to meet specific customer segmentsâ€™ needs. 
They consume too much regulatory and economic capital:

* Poor management of impaired loans
* Credit products not designed to optimize capital consumption

The shortcomings of legacy systems and processes have a negative impact on the customer experience. The poor automation level combined with the rework generated by non-quality results into higher costs which contributes to degrade UNI's cost/income ratio.


=== Operating model

Each brand is a legal entity that is fully owned by the RB Bank Group and manages its balance sheet and P&L. Financial and regulatory reporting is consolidated at the group level.

Each brand manages its own information system with minimum guidance from the group.

==== UNI operations

The UNI Operating Unit has adopted a classical retail banking organizational structure, see <<uni-org-chart>>.
