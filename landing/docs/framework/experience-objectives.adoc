In a seminal HBR paper footnote:[Marketing Myopia
by Theodore Levitt, Harvard Business Review, Best of 1960] Theodore Levitt argues that companies are overly focused on producing goods
 or services and donâ€™t spend enough time understanding what customers want or need.

 and analyze customers' wants and needs.
