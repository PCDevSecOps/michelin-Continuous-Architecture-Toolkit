= Rituals 

Through Continuous Architecture, we're promoting several mindset shifts:

* Architecture is a set of activities that are performed in teams where we should architects
* A dialog zone must be created so the team can exchange and debate on architecture. It's a place where the intentional architecture meets the emerging design.

Agile ceremonies that we know such as daily scrums, sprint planning ... put some discipline on the delivery operating model. Continuous Architecture rituals are inspired from this idea: we believe that having regular ceremonies with clear attendees and agenda at the team level will help to practice architecture collectively.

So far, we have documented several rituals
